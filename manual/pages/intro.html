<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>rot.js</strong> was designed to provide help with traditional chores of roguelike programming. It does not use or depend on any other JS framework or library. It is an Open Source Software released under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_License"></a>BSD License.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Just <a href="https://raw.github.com/ondras/rot.js/master/rot.js">download</a> the <strong>rot.js</strong> file and include it in your page. You can then start using the functions and objects in the <code>ROT</code> namespace.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="https://raw.github.com/ondras/rot.js/master/rot.min.js">minified version</a> available, compressed using Google's Closure compiler. This file is much smaller and suitable for production/deployment.</p>

<p>If you're using JVM-based build, you can setup the build system to download rot.js from <a href="http://www.webjars.org/">WebJars</a>.</p>
